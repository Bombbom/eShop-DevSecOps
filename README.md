DevSecOps eShop Project
=======================

Overview
--------

This project demonstrates the implementation of DevSecOps practices in a modern e-commerce application (eShop) built on Azure. It serves as a comprehensive example of how to integrate security throughout the entire DevOps workflow, from planning to production monitoring.

Project Objectives
------------------

-   Implement security-first DevOps practices (DevSecOps)
-   Demonstrate continuous security integration across all development phases
-   Showcase Azure-native security tools and services
-   Provide a real-world example of secure cloud application development

Architecture & Technology Stack
-------------------------------

### 2\. Development Phase Security

-   **Pre-commit Security Controls**: Security checks before code commits
-   **Secure Development Environment**: Hardened development setups
-   **Vulnerability Detection**: Early identification of security issues
-   **Security Linting**: Automated security rule enforcement

### 3\. Source Control Security

-   **Repository Security**: Access controls and branch protection

### 4\. Build Phase Security

-   **Secure CI Environment**: Hardened continuous integration pipelines
-   **SAST Integration**: Static Application Security Testing
-   **SCA Implementation**: Software Composition Analysis
-   **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of exposed secrets
-   **Build Process Hardening**: Secure build configurations

### 5\. Test & Release Phase Security

-   **Protected Branch Validation**: Ensure artifacts from secure sources
-   **Code Review Process**: Security-focused peer reviews
-   **Artifact Integrity**: Validation of release packages
-   **Infrastructure-as-Code Security**: IaC security scanning
-   **Release Gate Security**: Automated security validation before deployment

### 6\. Production Monitoring

-   **Continuous Security Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection
-   **Runtime Guardrails**: Azure-native security controls
-   **Application Risk Management**: Prevention, detection, and remediation
-   **Security Incident Response**: Automated response mechanisms
